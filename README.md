# Codename: Koding Spy

A puzzle adventure to teach programming

## Description

[![Koding Hackathon](/images/badge.png?raw=true "Koding Hackathon")](https://koding.com/Hackathon)

In this game we introduce Lucy, a spy from the '70s who has to recover stolen Diamonds to her home country. But first, she has to escape the bad guy's puzzle-filled headquarters.

Levels of pure puzzle-packed fun await the player who has to help Lucy escape by sending her instructions and learning to code Python at the same time.

Our mission with this game is to break the barrier of entrance into the world of programming for young people. We strongly believe that coding should be learned very early. We also strived to make a strong female lead character in an attempt to inspire more girls to try their hand at programming.

Our vision is to continue to improve this project in the upcoming months with the help of the open-source community and eventually submit it as an official [Hour of Code](http://hourofcode.com/) tutorial.

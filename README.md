And now we want to continue the project, taking it to the next level.

## The game

In this game we introduce Lucy, a groovy spy who has to recover the diamonds stolen by agents of the W.T.F. (World Thieves Federation). But first, she has to escape their laser-protected headquarters!

Levels of pure puzzle-packed fun await the player who has to help Lucy escape by sending her instructions while learning to code Python at the same time.

Our mission with this game is to break the barrier of entrance into the world of programming for young people. We strongly believe that coding should be learned very early. We also strived to make a strong female lead character in an attempt to inspire more girls to try their hand at programming, since we know there's a huge gender gap in this industry.

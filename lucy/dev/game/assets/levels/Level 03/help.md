Lucy can only escape each floor after collecting the !["Green Key"](/lucy/dev/game/assets/tiles/tileITEM.png) GREEN KEY.

Collecting all the !["Green Key"](/lucy/dev/game/assets/tiles/tileDIAMOND.png) DIAMONDS is **optional** but will give you more points!

Have you noticed that Lucy ignores lines that start with the `#` symbol?

```python
# moveForward(1) --> IGNORED!
moveForward(1) # --> Now she moves
```

Try it out now!

Execute the code once and then remove the `#` from the lines!
